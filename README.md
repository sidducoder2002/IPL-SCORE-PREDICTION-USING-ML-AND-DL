# IPL-SCORE-PREDICTION-USING-ML-AND-DL
Overview
Welcome to the IPL Score Prediction project! This project aims to predict the scores of Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches 
using machine learning techniques. The model has been trained on historical IPL match data to make predictions for upcoming matches.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)
Jupyter Notebook
Required Python packages (install using pip install -r requirements.txt)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-sidducoder2002/IPL-SCORE-PREDICTION-USING-ML-AND-DL.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ipl-score-prediction
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Navigate to the IPL_Score_Prediction.ipynb file.

Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to train the model and make predictions.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
models/: Stores the trained machine learning models.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and predictions.
src/: Source code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.
Data
The dataset used for training and testing the model is located in the data/ directory. The dataset includes features such as team performance, player statistics, and match details.

Model
The machine learning model is implemented using Python and scikit-learn. The trained model is saved in the models/ directory. The notebook provides details on model training and evaluation.
